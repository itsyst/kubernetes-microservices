To install Helm in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) running Ubuntu, you’ll need to set it up within your Ubuntu environment in WSL. Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, and installing it in WSL Ubuntu is similar to installing it on a native Ubuntu system. Below are step-by-step instructions to install Helm using the official installation script, which is one of the simplest and most reliable methods. I’ll assume you’re using a recent version of Ubuntu (e.g., 20.04 or 22.04) in WSL and have basic command-line access.
Prerequisites

    WSL Installed: Ensure WSL is set up with an Ubuntu distribution (e.g., Ubuntu-20.04). You can check this by running wsl -l in a Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell.
    Ubuntu Running: Open your WSL Ubuntu terminal (e.g., by typing wsl or ubuntu in a Windows terminal, or launching it from the Start menu).
    Internet Access: Your WSL Ubuntu instance needs internet connectivity to download Helm.
    kubectl (Optional): If you plan to use Helm with Kubernetes, ensure kubectl is installed and configured to connect to a cluster (like Minikube).

25 web pages

It seems like you want to install Helm from its GitHub repository (https://github.com/helm/helm) in your WSL Ubuntu environment. The GitHub page itself isn’t directly installable—it’s a source code repository—but it provides several ways to install Helm, including pre-built binaries, a script, or building from source. Since you’re in WSL Ubuntu and asked earlier about installing Helm, I’ll assume you want a straightforward method to get Helm running without necessarily building it from source (though I’ll include that option too). The most common and recommended approach for Ubuntu is using the official Helm installation script from the repository, which fetches the latest stable binary.

Here’s how to install Helm in WSL Ubuntu using the script from https://github.com/helm/helm:
Step 1: Update Package Lists

Ensure your package lists are up-to-date in WSL Ubuntu:
bash
sudo apt update
Step 2: Install Prerequisites

You’ll need curl to download the script:
bash
sudo apt install -y curl
Step 3: Download and Run the Helm Installation Script

The Helm project provides a script (get-helm-3) hosted on GitHub that downloads and installs the latest stable version of Helm. Run:
bash
curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
chmod 700 get_helm.sh
./get_helm.sh

    curl -fsSL: Downloads the script silently, following redirects.
    chmod 700: Makes the script executable.
    ./get_helm.sh: Runs the script, which installs Helm into /usr/local/bin/helm.

Expected output:
text
Downloading https://get.helm.sh/helm-v3.XX.X-linux-amd64.tar.gz
Verifying checksum... Done.
Preparing to install helm into /usr/local/bin
helm installed into /usr/local/bin/helm
Step 4: Verify Installation

Check that Helm is installed:
bash
helm version

Expected output (version may vary):
text
version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.XX.X", GitCommit:"...", GitTreeState:"clean", GoVersion:"go1.XX.X"}
Alternative: Install via Binary Manually

If you prefer downloading a specific version from GitHub releases:

    Visit https://github.com/helm/helm/releases and find the latest release (e.g., v3.15.0 as of early 2025).
    Download the Linux AMD64 binary:
    bash

curl -LO https://get.helm.sh/helm-v3.15.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
Extract and move it:
bash
tar -zxvf helm-v3.15.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo mv linux-amd64/helm /usr/local/bin/helm
Verify:
bash

    helm version

Alternative: Build from Source (Optional)

If you specifically want to install Helm by building it from the GitHub source (e.g., for the latest pre-release features):

    Install Go (required to build Helm):
    bash

sudo apt install -y golang
Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/helm/helm.git
cd helm
Build and install:
bash
make
sudo mv bin/helm /usr/local/bin/helm
Verify:
bash

    helm version

Note: Building from source uses the main branch (Helm v4 development, unstable as of April 2025). For stability, use the script or binary method instead.
Step 5: Clean Up (Optional)

If you used the script or binary method:
bash
rm get_helm.sh  # or rm helm-v3.15.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz linux-amd64/
Troubleshooting

    Permission Denied: Ensure you have sudo privileges or install Helm in a user-writable directory (e.g., ~/bin) and add it to your PATH:
    bash

    export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
    WSL Network Issues: If curl fails, check your WSL network (e.g., ping google.com). You might need to restart WSL (wsl --shutdown from Windows) or fix DNS.
    Old Helm Version: The script grabs the latest stable release; no need to worry about outdated versions.

Full Command Sequence (Recommended Script Method)
bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y curl
curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
chmod 700 get_helm.sh
./get_helm.sh
helm version
rm get_helm.sh
Next Steps

Run the commands above and share the output of:

    helm version

Once installed, you can add a chart repository (e.g., helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami) and start deploying charts to your Minikube cluster.


----
helm repo add nfs-subdire-external-provisioner https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner/
helm install nfs-subdir-external-provisioner nfs-subdir-external-provisioner/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner --set

----
Since you’re in Minikube, I’ll also ensure the solution fits your context (e.g., setting up an NFS provisioner for persistent storage).
Step 1: Understand the --set Error (Optional Fix)

The helm install command errored because --set was incomplete. The nfs-subdir-external-provisioner chart requires parameters like the NFS server address and path. Here’s how to install it correctly (if you still want it):
Example Install Command
bash
helm install nfs-subdir-external-provisioner nfs-subdir-external-provisioner/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner \
  --set nfs.server=<NFS_SERVER_IP> \
  --set nfs.path=/exported/path \
  --set storageClass.name=nfs-client

    nfs.server: Replace <NFS_SERVER_IP> with your NFS server’s IP (e.g., a local NFS server in WSL or Minikube).
    nfs.path: The exported directory on the NFS server (e.g., /mydata).
    storageClass.name: Name of the StorageClass this provisioner creates (e.g., nfs-client).

Prerequisite

You need an NFS server running. In Minikube/WSL, this is tricky without additional setup (e.g., running an NFS server in a pod or on your host). If you don’t have one, skip this for now and proceed to removing the repo.
Step 2: Remove the Helm Repository

Your output shows that Helm is successfully installed in your WSL Ubuntu environment (v3.17.2), and you’ve added a repository named nfs-subdire-external-pprovisioner from https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner/. However, your attempts to install the nfs-subdir-external-provisioner chart failed with Error: flag needs an argument: --set because the --set flag requires a key-value pair (e.g., --set key=value), but you didn’t provide one and left it incomplete. Now, you want to remove the nfs-subdire-external-pprovisioner repository. I’ll guide you through removing the repository and explain how to fix the installation if you still want to proceed with it later.
Step 1: Remove the Helm Repository

To remove the nfs-subdire-external-pprovisioner repository from your Helm configuration:
bash
helm repo remove nfs-subdire-external-pprovisioner

Expected output:
text
"nfs-subdire-external-pprovisioner" has been removed from your repositories
Verify Removal

List your repositories to confirm it’s gone:
bash
helm repo list

Expected output (assuming no other repos are added):
text
NAME   URL

If the nfs-subdire-external-pprovisioner entry is no longer listed, it’s successfully removed.
Step 2: Clean Up (Optional)

If you partially installed the chart (unlikely since the --set error stopped it), check for any releases:
bash
helm list

If you see nfs-subdir-external-provisioner, uninstall it:
bash
helm uninstall nfs-subdir-external-provisioner

Also, check for any related resources in your Minikube cluster:
bash
kubectl get all
kubectl get storageclass

If you see resources or a StorageClass from a partial install, you can delete them manually (e.g., kubectl delete deploy <name>).
Fixing the Original Install (Optional)

If you still want to install the nfs-subdir-external-provisioner chart after removing the repo (you’d need to re-add it), here’s why it failed and how to fix it:

    Error: Error: flag needs an argument: --set means you used --set without specifying a value. This chart requires configuration (e.g., NFS server details) via --set or a values file.

Correct Installation Example

Re-add the repo:
bash
helm repo add nfs-subdir-external-provisioner https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner/
helm repo update

Install with required values (e.g., assuming a local NFS server at 192.168.58.2—adjust to your setup):
bash
helm install nfs-subdir-external-provisioner nfs-subdir-external-provisioner/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner \
  --set nfs.server=192.168.58.2 \
  --set nfs.path=/exported/path \
  --set storageClass.name=nfs-client

    nfs.server: IP of your NFS server (e.g., Minikube VM or another host).
    nfs.path: Exported NFS directory.
    storageClass.name: Name of the StorageClass to create.

For Minikube, you’d need an NFS server running inside or accessible from the VM. A simpler alternative is sticking with Minikube’s standard StorageClass or local-path-provisioner unless you specifically need NFS.
Why Use nfs-subdir-external-provisioner?

You likely added this repo to set up an NFS-based storage provisioner, which supports ReadWriteMany access modes (unlike Minikube’s default standard, which is ReadWriteOnce). This would be useful for your earlier StatefulSet (web) that originally requested ReadWriteMany for shared storage across pods.
Full Command Sequence
bash
# Remove the repository
helm repo remove nfs-subdire-external-pprovisioner

# Verify
helm repo list

# Check for leftover releases (optional)
helm list
# helm uninstall nfs-subdir-external-provisioner  # Uncomment if needed
Next Steps

Run the commands above and share the output of:

    helm repo list

This will confirm the nfs-subdire-external-pprovisioner repo is removed.
